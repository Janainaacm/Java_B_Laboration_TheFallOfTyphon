                springs of Castalia, Pythia fell into a trance more profound than ever before. She saw herself ascending the steps of the Temple of Apollo, adorned in priestess \s
                robes. The god Apollo himself appeared in her vision, bestowing upon her the divine gift of prophecy. From that moment, she was chosen to be the Oracle of Delphi, \s
                the voice of the gods, and the bridge between the mortal and divine realms.She lived within the Temple of Apollo, where she inhaled the mystical fumes rising from \s
                the chasm in the temple floor. These intoxicating vapors helped her enter a state of trance, where she could channel the wisdom of the gods and provide guidance to \s
                all who sought her counsel.\s
